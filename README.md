## Spotify Genre Popularity

## Project Overview
I am a contracted Data Analyst for a stakeholder who is an aspiring artist seeking to make a breakthrough in the music industry who needs data driven insights on what is popular among listeners in one of the biggest music streaming platforms known as Spotify.

## ASK

2. What genres are most popular among listeners?
3. How can I maximize user streams?

## Prepare
Our stakeholder encourages me to use public data on Kaggle that explores various Spotify information including: Track popularity, playlist genre and playlist subgenre.

## Process
The tools used for my Analysis and Sharing include Python and Google Sheets.

Final recommendations for business strategies with data-driven insights:

1. My data analysis has concluded that genres in Latin and Pop are most marketable as they are two of the highest streamed genres on Spotify. Suggestions for client include considering producing music that incorparate sounds associated with Pop and Latin genres.
2. My analysis further discovered that subgenres play a factor as certain subgenres are more popular than others contributing to total genre popularity. Focusing on what subgenre is most popular within genres can contribute to what most listeners like.
3. Quantity of genre tracks on platform does not correlate to what users actively listen to more. Pursing a popular genre among listeners is a better strategy to grow ones visibilty.
